# inf510_project

Hi!

My project is using fast food restaurant location data from yelp, and I also use their sales data and GDP data of the regions they belong to. 

I also update the data cleaning part of Milestone 2 in yelpdataorganize.ipynb. But this is just a preparation for Milestone 3. I added it here just to make the process connected together.

I learned a lot in this semester, Thank you for your help!
